### Grammar Notes
"**Tu es**" is for informal or familiar situations, used with friends, family, or people of similar age.

"**Vous Ãªtes**" can be formal (for one person you don't know well or in professional contexts) or plural.

"**On est**" is an informal way to say "**We are**" and is commonly used in spoken French instead of "**Nous sommes**."
